# a General survey analysis
### Project Description
In one of Iran's leading medical universities, a team initiated a project to explore a novel idea in the field of nutrition tailored for the Iranian society. To evaluate the feasibility of this idea, the team designed and distributed an online survey targeting relevant stakeholders.

As a data scientist, I was engaged to assess the survey's data and provide an expert opinion on its reliability and the validity of its results. The primary goal was to determine whether the survey outcomes were robust enough to support the team's hypothesis and potentially attract investor interest.
